# An Intelligent Decision Support System for Movie Production Company

* The proposed model is an intelligent decision support system for the movie production company to make decisions at the earliest stage of production and thus prevent huge investment losses.
* The system recommends the right combination of actors, directors and the countries to release the movie prior the investment is made which will help in maximizing the profit of the production company. 
* The proposed system uses hybrid algorithm to recommend based on the detailed analysis of the Internet Movie Database(IMDb), Box Office Mojo and The Movies Dataset that uses both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques for better recommendation.
